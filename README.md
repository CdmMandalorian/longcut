The Long Cut:  
As an adventurer  
I like to take my time exploring new trails, roads, or monuments.  
I would like to have an app that shows me the scenic route for my adventure options   
When I choose a scenic route, I want it to record if I completed it  
While completing the routes, I want it to save my records  
When I look at my records I want to see completed trails,maps,and monuments.  
When I look for a new exploration, I want it to suggest where to go based off my location  


Demo: (insert working GIF here upon completion)
